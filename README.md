# Why Use Docker?

Containers make it a lot easier to develop, deploy, and maintain software. Here are some of the benefits of containerizing your applications:

## Self Contained Environments

A container packages all of the dependencies to run a specific application. We never have to worry about local package conflicts when running our programs. This prevents “works on my machine” syndrome when working in a team. We can just run the container and have a fully working environment! 

## Portable

Container execution is independent of the host operating system allowing them to run consistently across different platforms or cloud services. 

## Fast and Efficient

Containers share the host OS kernel and doesn’t need a hypervisor like virtual machines. They require a lot less space than VMs and can be run or stopped significantly faster as well. All of this speed and efficiency leads to easier scaling, less server costs, and fewer resource requirements.

## Convenient Management & Scaling

Every container is isolated and operates independently. Container runtimes and images are also standardized (OCI standard). This allows us to automate container scaling, monitoring, debugging, and management using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. 

## Failure Isolation and Recovery

Since containers are isolated from each other, a failure in a specific container doesn’t impact any other containers. Developers can identify, isolate, and fix the issue without any downtime in other containers. Additionally, the previously mentioned orchestration tools can spawn another container and reroute any traffic from the failed container to further reduce downtime.
